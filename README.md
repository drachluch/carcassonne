# carcassonne
Js project. Abandoned years ago. Written by a mad man. Unreadable.


Only Client side.
Help in french only.
It makes you abble to play the board game [Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)).

Open index.html in a navigator. Click the "Nouvelle partie" button (in the form, not in the left column). Press the space key. The board completes itself.
You can choose where to put the tiles, rotate them : only legal moves are possible (of course). You can put followers too, read "Help" for it. And learn french. Points are counted. Farms may not work..., and bug.
